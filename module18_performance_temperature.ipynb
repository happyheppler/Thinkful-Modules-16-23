    "* First, load the dataset from the weatherinszeged table from Thinkful's database.\n",
    "* Like in the previous checkpoint, build a linear regression model where your target variable is the difference between the apparenttemperature and the temperature. As explanatory variables, use humidity and windspeed. Now, estimate your model using OLS. What are the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values? Do you think they are satisfactory? Why?\n",
    "* Next, include the interaction of humidity and windspeed to the model above and estimate the model using OLS. Now, what is the R-squared of this model? Does this model improve upon the previous one?\n",
    "* Add visibility as an additional explanatory variable to the first model and estimate it. Did R-squared increase? What about adjusted R-squared? Compare the differences put on the table by the interaction term and the visibility in terms of the improvement in the adjusted R-squared. Which one is more useful?\n",
